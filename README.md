# Arduino-Uno-Alarm-Clock-DS1307
Welp, this is the official Arduino Uno DS1307 alarm clock v0.1, I will be updating this occasionally, probably every month
# What you need to do
Navagate to the Code folder, there you will find 2 (currently) files, the first one, SetTime, will be you setting up your DS1307 RTC module, and you will find another file in the Circuit Wiring folder which includes a screenshot of how the DS1307 should be connected to the Arduino Uno.
Next, you have to navagate in the Code folder to the ReadTimeTest sketch, which is what you will need in order to make the DS1307 RTC module display the time and date correctly on the Serial Monitor, by clicking Tools then Serial Monitor (on macOS).
